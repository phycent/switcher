# From feedback
* customizing look and feel with themes
* Optionally darken screen / some similar effect when showing the switcher
* Optionally search by non-localized name too

# Bugs
* On gnome-shell 3.38.1, an error message "No JS module 'tweener' found in search path" is encountered.

# Otherwise
* Activating with double modifier key (shift, alt, ctrl) if at all possible with JS only
